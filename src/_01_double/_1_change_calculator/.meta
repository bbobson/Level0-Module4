  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/changeCalculator.jpg"/>


  ## Goal:


  Use the variable type double to store decimal values and calculate the value of
  the change (coins) the user has.


  ## Steps:


  1. Ask the user how many nickels they have.

  2. Multiply the number of nickels by 0.05 to calculate the dollar value of the nickels
  (i.e. it will be a decimal).

  3. Repeat the above steps for dimes (multiply by 0.10) and quarters (multiply by
  0.25).

  4. Now calculate the total value of the money and tell the user how much they have
  in dollars and cents format:   e.g.  $3.75
