# Test Scores

## Goal:

Tell the user their grade! Use double variables to allow for decimals,

## Steps:

1. Write code to ask the user for their test score.

Your program MUST allow the user to enter a test score that has a DECIMAL, e.g. 75.5
2. Give them a different message according to their score.

Example, for a good score: "Wow! You must have studied really hard for that test!"

HINT: Think about how you would convert a String to an int and use SIMILAR code to convert their test score to a double.
